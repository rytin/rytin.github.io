What Safety Issues Should You Be Concerned About?</h2>

<p>Phentermine is a diet pill prescribed by doctors as an appetite suppressant to help reduce weight in overweight patients. Most doctors prescribe phentermine for short-term use. Phentermine is an appetite suppressant of the amphetamine and phenethylamine class. Beta-phenethylamine pharmacological derivative agents include fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentermine and sibutramine.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn about a natural diet pill with hardly any side effects, consider <a href="http://www.dietrxpill.info/">Diet Rx</a>, a doctor formulated herbal product which does not have phentermine.</p>

<h2 id="phentermine-diet-pill-dosage">Phentermine Diet Pill Dosage</h2>

<p>Phentermine should not be used longer than 8 to12 weeks. Some patients prescribed phentermine diet pill develop drug tolerance, whereby phentermine does not work as well as it did the first few weeks as an appetite suppressant.</p>

<h2 id="phentermine-diet-pill-side-effect">Phentermine Diet Pill Side Effect</h2>

<p>Insomnia are dry mouth are common phentermine side effects. Rapid heart beat is another common high dose phentermine diet pill side effect. Diet Rx natural diet pill does not have these side effects. Some researchers think phentermine causes valvular heart disease with prolonged use.</p>

<p><strong>Effects on weight reduction and safety of short-term phentermine administration in Korean obese people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yonsei Med J. 2006. Department of Family Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea.</strong></p>

<p>Phentermine diet pill, an appetite suppressant, has been widely used in Korea since 2004. The aim of this study doen at Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea was to determine the effect of phentermine diet pill on weight reduction. Obese subjects received phentermine HCl 37.5 mg or placebo once daily with behavioral therapy for obesity. Mean decrease of both body weight and waist circumference in phentermine diet pill treated subjects were significantly greater than that of placebo group. Significant number of subjects in phentermine diet pill group accomplished weight reduction of 5% or greater from the baseline and 10% or more. There were no significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the groups. Dry mouth and insomnia were the only statistically significant adverse events that occurred more frequently in phentermine diet pill group. Most side effects of phentermine were mild to moderate in intensity.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>Q: Until recently I was prescribed Phentermine diet pill as an appetite suppressant, but my doctor said it was time to stop taking it because it is only for temporary use. Phentermine has worked very well to curb my appetite so that I am not hungry all the time and when I am I eat far less than I previously did. I have lost about thirty pounds since May or June, but I’d like to lose 30 more pounds to get to my ideal weight according to the doctor’s chart (about 165-170 lbs). Are there any herbal alternatives for appetite suppression? I have tried Hoodia before, but it required me to take two tablets three times a day. That schedule just does not work for me, so Hoodia did not work for me. I question whether some things that seem so popular are truly what the media hype makes them out to be.</p>

<p><em>A: In our opinion, a combination product I have formulated, called Diet Rx, works quite well as an appetite suppressant.</em></p>
