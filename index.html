<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are countless over the counter natural weight loss pills and a dozen or more prescription medications for weight loss. As a general rule, the prescription medications have more side effects and are more expensive. Many consumers search for natural options and are bewildered by the variety of diet pills on the market, whether in health food stores, pharmacies, or online. Scientific comparison studies are not available to determine which of the over the counter diet pills are most effective. Hence, the consumer is left with little choice but to try one or two products they purchase to see if they work.</span></p>

<p>Diet Rx is an effective natural diet pill on the market for appetite suppression, and you don’t need a prescription. It is formulated by world renowned nutrition expert and medical doctor Ray-Sahelian, M.D. who has tested the product with his patients. Dr. Sahelian says, “I am quite impressed at how well Diet Rx works. Appetite is reduced without feeling stimulated. Most people consume about 20 percent less food each day. I have studied natural supplements for more than 30 years and this product is the culmination of my research and knowledge into natural ways to reduce appetite with the fewest side effects.” The benefits of this appetite suppressant do not last when the pills are stopped, so this product only works while it is being used. Appetite will likely return to normal a day or two after stopping the pills. We suggest taking a week off after each bottle is completed.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Diet Rx all natural diet pill benefits<br /> All Natural Appetite Suppressant. The ingredients in Diet Rx are listed below and also at the link provided below the bottle.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img src="http://www.dietrxpill.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/dietrx-6cm.jpg" alt="" width="83" height="133" align="left" border="0" />Decreases appetite so you eat less<br /> Helps you maintain healthy blood sugar levels. When you eat less, your blood sugar does not rise as much.<br /> Helps you maintain healthy cholesterol and lipid levels. When you eat less, your cholesterol level does not rise as high.<br /> Provides a variety of antioxidant from two dozen herbs and nutrients<br /> Provides healthy fiber<br /> Improves energy in a natural way so you take more walks and use up more calories.<br /> Improves mental concentration and focus<br /> Improves will power and choice of food selection</span></p>

<p><strong>Suggested use:</strong> <span style="font-family: Arial;">T</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">ake two capsules on an empty stomach at least half an hour before breakfast or lunch. Increase on subsequent days to 3 or 4 based on your needs. May take all at once or preferably split between morning and midday. Take a break one day a week and a few days each month. Consult with your health care provider regarding the use of Diet Rx particularly if you have a health condition or taking medicines.</span></p>

<p>Another option is to take 2 capsules before breakfast, one before lunch, and another in late afternoon.  <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">Caffeine is known to enhance some of the effects of the ingredients. We prefer that people limit their coffee use to two cups a day if taking 2 Diet Rx pills, and one cup a day if taking 3 or 4 capsules. </span></p>

<p><span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Use during pregnancy</strong><br /> Is a Diet Rx pill safe to use during pregnancy?</span></span></p>

<p><em>We have not tested it in women who are pregnant. We would not suggest using it while pregnant since we don’t have a good idea of benefits and risks. We wish you a wonderful healthy baby.</em></p>

<p><span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Use with antidepressant medication</strong><br /> I take a very small dose of Lexapro (2.5 -5 mg daily usually 2.5) and 5 mg of Lipitor. I am concerned about the grapefruit extract in Diet Rx and the Lipitor precaution against grapefruit. Is there another diet supplement I can use? I have gained 15 nasty pounds from Lexapro that I can’t lose even though I eat healthy and am very active.</span></span></p>

<p><em>It is not easy to predict interactions between medications and supplements, especially if more than one medication is used. The amount of grapefruit extract in this</em> _ <span style="font-family: Arial;">diet pill </span> <span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial;">is small. A good option, whenever adding a new supplement, is to begin with a low dosage. If your doctor approves you can take one capsule of Diet Rx in the morning for a few days and then decide with your doctor if a second capsule can be added. If a person eats less their cholesterol level is likely to be lower. </span></span>_</p>

<p><span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>With thyroid medication</strong><br /> I have been reading the interesting information on your website and I am considering purchasing CLA and trying Diet Rx. Before I do, though, I would like to ask you whether you know of any contraindications with Armour Thyroid, which I take every morning first thing when I get up. I take Armour for hypothyroidism and wondered if I could take Diet Rx. I have no other health problems that I know of and I am a 53 year old female. Recently I started taking 5 HTP for sleep at 50mg.</span></span></p>

<p><em>It is difficult to predict interactions of medications with supplements. As a general rule, and if your doctor approves, you can begin with one capsule in the morning on an empty stomach for a few days, and if no interactions or side effects, you could take 2 capsules. But this is a decision you have to make with your health care provider since it is not possible for us to predict your response. Some people taking thyroid medications may do well with 2 capsules whereas others may find interactions with even one capsule. Armour Thyroid is a type of hormone replacement therapy. It differs from other therapies in two important ways: It is a natural product—not a synthetic compound. It provides both of the key thyroid hormones levothyroxine (T4) and L-triiodothyronine (T3).</em></p>

<p><span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Influence on sleep and insomnia</strong><br /> Just a quick question about this formula. I have just stopped taking a prescription sleep med and for the last 6 months have had a very difficult time sleeping. I’m finally sleeping on my own. Will the Diet Rx make me sleepless? I really need to be careful about this because this has been a horrendous 6 months trying to kick the sleep meds. I can’t take any kind of decongestants or anything like that because they make me bounce off the walls.</span></span></p>

<p><em>We have had no reports of 2 or 3 pills of this formula taken in the morning causes sleep problems.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Best Diet Pill</strong><br /> There are thousands of online diet pills on the market with or without Rx. How does one know which one is the best?</span></p>

<p><em>This is not an easy question to answer. There are no studies that compare all these with or without Rx diet pills. There are thousands of online weight loss supplements being marketed, and many more in health food stores, pharmacies, grocery stores, and retail outlets. One option is to ask the opinion of a friend who has had success with a natural diet pill product or buy one or two of them that look honest and reputable and see how they work for you.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Combining with fiber</strong><br /> Can I take psyllium fiber if I am using Diet Rx diet pill?</span></p>

<p><em>Sure. You can take it on an empty stomach and then take half a teaspoon of psyllium or a glucomannan fiber supplement pill with your meals. Make sure you drink a few ounces of water when you take additional fiber supplements. Fiber supplements can help you feel fuller so you have less of a tendency to overeat.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><strong>Q. Is it okay to take 5 Diet Rx pills a day? I like the effects on 4 capsules but I was thinking 5 may even work better.</strong><br /> <em>A. We have not tested the use of 5 capsules. If your doctor approves, and you are young and very healthy with no medical problems, you could take 3 before breakfast, 2 before lunch, and one before dinner. We do suggest you take a good long walk to use us any excess energy the pills provide.</em> </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Q. I take quite a number of supplements, including multivitamins, garlic pills, resveratrol, curcumin, pomegranate extract, and a few others. Is it okay to add Diet Rx to this regimen?<br /> </span></strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">A. We suggest the first few days that you start Diet Rx by itself until you have a good sense of how many capsules are effective. Then, you can gradually add the other supplements.</span></em></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Q. Is a </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>diet pill for a woman different that a diet pill for a man? Do women respond differently to ingredients in diet pills?</strong><br /> <em>A. With almost all herbs and natural diet pills, the response by men and women is largely similar. Women may need a lower dosage since they have less body weight.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Q. What do you recommend as a diet pill for fast weight loss?</strong><br /> <em>A. We are only familiar with Diet Rx and it is a diet pill that suppresses appetite. It works. We are certain there are many herbal diet pills for fast weight loss marketed by a number of companies, but we don’t have any first hand experience. Out of the thousands of all natural diet pills on the market, we are sure some of them work for some people.</em> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><strong>Q. I have diabetes type two. If I eat less will I need to reduce my dosage of insulin or blood sugar lowering medicines if I take a pharmaceutical or natural diet pill that reduces appetite? What about cholesterol medications and blood pressure medications?</strong><br /> <em>A. Perhaps. If you eat less, there is a good chance your blood sugar will not rise as much. Therefore, if you are on insulin or taking prescription medicines or natural supplements that lower blood sugar, you dosage may need to be adjusted. If you have diabetes, you should consult with your doctor before taking any diet pills. Your doctor may advise you to start with a low dose of these pills while you monitor your blood sugar. You may then gradually increase the dosage of the diet pills while you keep a close eye on your blood sugar level. The same may apply to blood pressure and cholesterol. If you eat less, whether through sheer will power or through the aid of an appetite suppressant, it is possible that cholesterol levels would not rise as high and blood pressure may not rise as much. Thus, you need to have your doctor monitor you and guide you.</em> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Q: Do you ship this product to Australia or is it available in my country in a store?</strong><br /> <em>A: It is not in stores, but this natural product can be shipped to Australia and New Zealand.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Q: I really want to try this product. but I have one question. I am really sensitive to caffiene. can I take this product? what are the true side effects of this product. I can tolerate one cup of green tea with no problem. is the caffiene equivalent to that?</strong><br /> <em>A: There is no additional caffeine in this product. One option is, the first day, to open a capsule and take half the contents. if no problems the next day a full capsule can be tried and gradually increased to 2 capsules in the morning. It is not possible for us to predict any one person’s reaction to any supplement product or medication.</em> </span></p>

<p><strong>What Diet Rx diet pill does not have</strong>:</p>

<p>This natural appetite suppressant has no added caffeine, ephedra or ephedrine alkaloids, synephrine, conjugated linoleic acid, guarana or stimulating amino acids. Users do not feel jittery and restless. Rather, many people report feeling more balanced with a more focused mind.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Caffeine has not been added to Diet Rx although green tea extract has small amounts of natural caffeine. Caffeine use may lead to anxiety, irritability, nervousness and sleep disorders for some users.  However, most people who like the effects of caffeine, normally drink a cup or two of coffee a day which provides 100 to 200 mg of caffeine. Those who drink two or more cups of coffee may wish to take one less capsule of Diet Rx. For instance, if three capsules of Diet Rx normally works for you, take 2 capsules if you plan to drink 2 or more cups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Diet Rx Testimonials<br /> </strong><em>I have been taking Diet Rx for one week now. I have noticed that I do not feel hungry. The biggest difference that I noticed though is no night time snacking. I never go to bed before 2:00am and usually start my evening snacking around 10:00pm I must clarify that what I call a “snack” other people call a meal. I am not fond of sweets so therefore my “snack” is something meaty (pork chop, chicken breast or steak) or a sandwich or two with all the trimmings. I have not even thought about having something to eat in the evenings since starting it. I tried a diet pill once before in my life but did not like it because it gave me an awful nervous feeling and fast heart beat. I don’t feel anything like that with this diet product. In one week I lost three pounds.</em></span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">My 60 year old secretary comes into work today looking fabulous and says that since she’s been taking Diet Rx she has lost eight lbs in about 2 weeks. She is a real testament because not everything works on her. She says that she hasn’t really been hungry during these two weeks and no urges for sweets either. A year ago her doctor put her on a prescription diet pill and after six months there was no change in her weight.</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have been taking 2 Diet Rx capsules daily for two weeks and have lost 4 pounds. This is a lot for me because I am 5′ 5″ tall and started out at only 130 lbs. Diet Rx curbs my appetite more than anything else I have ever used. Another important benefit is that I don’t experience any of the uncomfortable side effects, such as the jitters, that other supplements with harmful stimulants always do. I feel comfortable using this product because I know that it contains a lot of beneficial ingredients. I just ordered 2 more bottles and am looking forward to reaching my goal weight of 120 very soon with Diet Rx.</span></em></p>

<p><span class="CPprodDet"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"> <strong>Ingredients in Diet Rx – Proprietary Blend 894 mg per two capsules:<br /> Ginger root</strong> (Zingiber officinalis),<strong> Green tea extract</strong> (Camellia sinensis, standardized to contain 50% polyphenols), <strong>Spirulina</strong> (Spirulina platensis), <strong>Hoodia extract</strong> (Hoodia gordonii, 20 to 1 extract), Cinnamon root (Cinnamomum cassia), <strong>Apple Cider vinegar, Apple pectin, Garcinia Cambogia CitriMax</strong> HCA-600 SXS (standardized to contain 60% hydroxycitric acid), <strong>Glucomannan konjac 4 to 1 extract</strong>, <strong>Grapefruit extract</strong> (Citrus paradise, 4 to 1 extract), Acetyl-l-Carnitine, Alpha lipoic acid, <strong>Banaba extract</strong> (standardized to contain 1 % corosolic acid), 5-HTP, <strong>Choline</strong> bitartrate, Inositol, Carnitine (Hcl), <strong>Pomegranate</strong> (standardized to contain 40 % ellagic acid), <strong>Bitter melon</strong> extract (Momordica charantia), <strong>Psyllium</strong> husk, <strong>Coleus forskohlii</strong> (standardized to contain 10 % forskohlin), <strong>Fenugreek</strong> seed extract 4 to 1 (Trigonella foenum), <strong>Guggul</strong> herb (standardized to contain 10 % guggulsterones), and Inulin. <strong>Chromium picolinate mineral. </strong></span></span> <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Diet Rx is trademarked by Advance Physician Formulas.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Diet Pill Review</strong><br /> There are thousands of diet pills online, grocery stores, health food stores, pharmacies, and large retail outlets. It is impossible to provide a diet pill review that would include all or most of these over the counter diet pills. We have not seen any research that compares one diet pill product versus another. How is the consumer to know which diet pill they buy online or in a store will work for them? It is impossible to tell unless one tries these products. There is very little published research on natural diet pill products. It is too expensive to do and most vitamin companies cannot afford to spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on this type of research. They don’t have the budget that pharmaceutical companies have.</span></p>

<p><strong>Diet Pill that Works</strong></p>

<p>We have no experience with the thousands of herbal or natural diet pills on the market. It would seem reasonable that many diet pills do work and others don’t. We do know through feedback and experience that Diet Rx really works.</p>

<p><strong>Diet Pill Review and Comparisons</strong></p>

<p>You will find many websites that review diet pills. Be careful believing everything you read. Most of the time these diet pill review sites promote their own product that they say good things about, and then they give lower ratings to their competitors. Do not trust these types of diet pill comparisons and do not trust these diet pill ratings.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Diet Rx and Lexapro escitalopram oxalate – Combining a natural diet pill with SSRI drugs, Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil</strong><br /> Q. I know you recommend speaking to a physician prior to taking Diet Rx diet pill if taking a prescription drug. But, have you ever heard from anyone that may have taken the a no Rx diet pill while on Lexapro escitalopram oxalate? I know all individuals react differently to meds. and supplements. For me, Lexapro increases appetite and causes weight gain slowing down ones metabolism.</span></p>

<p><em>A. Yes, you are right. Everyone reacts slightly, moderately, or sometimes significantly differently to the same medication or a combination of medications and herbal products. As a general rule, we suggest starting with one capsule of Diet Rx for those on Lexapro or other SSRI antidepressant drugs. After a couple of days one can increase to two Diet Rx pills. At this time, it may be a good idea to reduce the Lexapro dosage by a quarter or so. Diet Rx has some mood stabilizing properties. These are general guidelines that you can inform your doctor who will make the final decision as to whether Diet Rx diet pill is appropriate for you, and if it is, how to manage your dosage of Lexapro while taking this natural diet pill. The guidelines provided for Diet Rx use with Lexapro are similar to the use of this all natural diet pill with the SSRI drugs listed below.</em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">SSRI drugs include<br /> Citalopram (Celexa, Cipramil, Sepram, Seropram)<br /> Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro, Cipralex)<br /> Fluoxetine (Prozac, Fontex, Seronil, Sarafem)<br /> Fluvoxamine maleate (Luvox, Faverin)<br /> Paroxetine (Paxil, Seroxat, Aropax, Deroxat, Rexetin, Paroxat)<br /> Sertraline (Zoloft, Lustral, Serlain)</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">When using any of the SSRI antidepressant drugs with Diet Rx diet pill, consider starting with one capsule of Diet Rx your first time, and when you increase the dosage of Diet Rx to two capsules, we suggest you lower the SSRI drug dosage by about 10 to 30 percent.

<p>Recently I sent for a sample of DietRx. However, I’ve been trying to find information about it on the Internet without any luck. All I found is the information on your website. Are there other reviews, articles, or comments on the Internet that refers to DietRx?</p>

<p><em>We are not aware of reliable and independent reviews.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Questions and Comments:</strong><br /> I ordered a couple of different weight loss pills from different companies and they had no effect on me in terms of appetite.</span></p>

<p><em>We are not sure why some people respond and others don’t. We look at our orders and many people get the free sample and return a week or two later to buy a full bottle or two, sometimes 3 or 4, but others don’t. It’s a puzzle to us why these products work in some and not in others. Same with Viagra, it seems to work in 7 out of 10 men and doctors are not sure why it doesn’t work in 30 percent of users. As to appetite, some people respond to citrus aurantium, others to hoodia, others to green tea extract, but it is not possible to predict in anyone which supplements or medications will work for them.</em></p>
